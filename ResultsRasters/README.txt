- PredictionsNoLC : the predicted average probability of being No-LC per grid cell with the spatial dataset
- PredictionsMorphNoLC:  the predicted average probability of being No-LC per grid cell with the spatial+morpho dataset
- CountsSpatialNoLC: number of observations classified as noLC by IUCN, per grid cell 
- Predictions_morpho_end:  the predicted average probability of being No-LC per grid cell with spatial+morpho, only using species that are restricted to each region yes.
- CountsMorphoNoLC: number of observations classified as noLC by IUCN, per grid cell and for species with morphological data available
- PredictionsEndemic: the predicted average per grid cell with spatial data, only using species that are restricted to each region yes, for No-LC
- PredictionsGlobal: the predicted average probability of being No-LC per grid cell with the spatial dataset, and only species that are present in more than one region.
- PredictionsGlobalMorph: the predicted average probability of being No-LC per grid cell with the spatial+morpho dataset, and only species that are present in more than one region.
